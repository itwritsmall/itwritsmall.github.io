## Introduction

VSphere PowerCLI can be used to automate the management of nearly all elements of a VMWare infrastructure.  PowerCLI is a Powershell add-on and Powershell can be installed on Windows or Linux.  This post will go the Linux route and install Powershell and PowerCLI onto Ubuntu Desktop.  Also available for WIndows and Linux is VIsua Studio Code, which will serve as an IDE for the combo.

## Goals

This post will step you through the process of getting a VSphere PowerCLI environment installed so that you can write code that automates the management of VMWare environments.

## Prerequisites

1. A virtual or physical machine with Ubuntu 18.04 (you can go newer, but this is written based on that version) Desktop installed
1. A VMWare environment running VCenter

### Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop

I'm using the 64-bit edition, not sure if it matters but I'm certain I'm not going to spend time finding out.  Be good to yourself and get the extra 32 bits.  It's version 18.04.4 LTS.

### VMWare

You'll need a VMWare environment or what is the point of all of this?  If you are using the Free edition of ESXi, PowerCLI will be limited to read only capabilities.  A licensed vCenter installation gets you the ability to also write.

### Step 1- Installing and Configuring Visual Studio Code

The first five steps in this post could be done in nearly any order, but if Visual Studio Code is installed first then the rest of the tasks can be done from within the program.
