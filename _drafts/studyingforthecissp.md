## Read the book and take notes
## Consolidate notes

Watched Cybrary videos

use the Sybex exam essentials.  Organize the essentials then organize your notes to respond.  Copy notes out of reading notes, create tables.  Highlight anything where your notes don't adequately match up with the exam essentials.
As an example, I couldn't find anything answering "Understand how to create a training program" in my notes (or in the chapter).

Consolidate my reading notes and my Cybrary notes into consolidated notes for each Sybex Chapter

Answered the written labs using my consolidated notes.  If something was aseked that wasn't answered in my consolidated notes I went back to my original notes and copied the information over.  Highlight anything where your notes don't adequately match up with the exam essentials.  As an example, I couldn't find anything answering "Understand how to create a training program" in my notes (or in the chapter).

Answered the Sybex review questions without notes as much as possible but referred to notes when I didn't know the answers.  Wrote down my thinking behind the answers or showed my work for the calculations,also indicated when my answer was a WAG.  when I missed a question, I kept close track of WHY.  Did I not read it, was the info not in my notes, did the question contradict the book, etc.
