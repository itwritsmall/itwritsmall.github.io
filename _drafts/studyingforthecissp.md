## Read the book and take notes
## Consolidate notes
use the Sybex exam essentials.  Organize the essentials then organize your notes to respond.  Copy notes out of reading notes, create tables.  Highlight anything where your notes don't adequately match up with the exam essentials.
As an example, I couldn't find anything answering "Understand how to create a training program" in my notes (or in the chapter).
