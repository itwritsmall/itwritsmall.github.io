# Why is this here?
This blog is based (mostly) on my belief that no matter the size of the organization, there are a number of IT technologies, practices and processes that **must** be implemented.  There is, in fact, a right way to do information technology.  It is informed by the reality that smaller organizations face significant constraints in talent, money and time.

# Who is this for?
This site is for anyone who owns the information technology function in their organization in part or whole.  Frequently, this is going to be someone who does not have an enterprise technology background.  Sometimes, IT may not be the way they have chosen to waste their college education.  The responsibility for their organizations technology may have been heaped on top of their real job.  Often it will be someone who is directing rather than performing the work, maybe a CFO who has hired a third-party provider.  It may also be a "true" technology professional who is looking for guidance on improving their environment.  Whatever the case, they face internal and external requirements to implement a sound IT Platform.

# Who would do such a thing?
I have many (many, many) years of experience managing the technology function for small (< 300 user) organizations.  My interest is on building environments that are secure, efficient and reliable.  I've had the opportunity to do this for a number of companies, all of them having IT needs disproportionately greater than their IT resources.
